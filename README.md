# X-wing Miniatures Overlay Generator
Work in Progress.

## Overview
Generates a HTML overlay for use in OBS Studio (or similar, not really attempted anything else) for streaming X-wing miniatures games.

Takes XWS files as imports, and allows many of them. Generates the starting stats for the ship based on the base values + upgrades. Pair up squads to create a 'match' and the overlay is generated.

When a match is created, a control panel is available that uses websockets to push the changes (e.g. losing shield/hull, discarding upgrade cards) back to the overlay in realtime, no overlay editing required.

Uses lots of good stuff made by other people: please see point 1 in ToDo for why I've not listed them here...

Feedback & Contributions welcome!

Now with WorksForMeâ„¢ vagrant-y goodness:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheepeatingtaz/xwingoverlayer.git
cd xwingoverlayer
vagrant up
```

Open a browser and got to http://localhost:8008 and you're in!

Alternatively: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/sheepeatingtaz/xwingoverlayer)
(nb: It uses a custom heroku Buildpack, as I couldn't work out for the life of me how to get it to run the initial setup needed before collectstatic can be run - contributions welcome!)
